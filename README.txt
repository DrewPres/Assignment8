This program utilizes a BST to store a key and data. The program will use the key to find the max and min of the leafs of the tree. 
It can set, find, print, min, max, save, and delete nodes. 
I do not have the program where it can read from a file. The data has to manually be inserted using the insert function to get data into the tree. 
I was not able to do the bonus work for the project. 
Some of my functions have issues using the recursive calling where it will print the correct value first, but then it will continue printing the
values that are next in line in the BST without matching the correct criteria.
